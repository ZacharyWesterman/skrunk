			<h3>Important Notes:</h3>
			Notifications follow certain guidelines to keep them as useful as possible.
			<ol>
				<li>They should be infrequent. Any more than a few notifications per day is spam!</li>
				<li>They must only contain important information. Aim for concise and precise.</li>
				<li>No manipulative language. Our robots get really sad when we prod users for emotional response <i
						class="fa-regular fa-face-frown"></i></li>
			</ol>
