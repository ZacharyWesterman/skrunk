In most cases, just inputting the title will be enough.
In fact, you can even put the author (or part of the description!) in the title field, and that will usually give you the correct result!

Note that there may be some books that do not have any results. This can happen if the book is very old, or if it's a rare or unpublished volume.
When that happens, it's fine to just select the closest fit, or you can input the info manually.
