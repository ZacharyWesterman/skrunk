	<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a> and search for your location, or click anywhere on the map.
The latitude and longitude will be displayed in the search bar.
You can then copy and paste them into the appropriate Lat and Lon fields.

Note that the weather alert system will <b class="emphasis">never</b> track where you <i>actually are</i>,
