your search.

		Borrowed

			<ul>
				<li>
					If checked<input type="checkbox" checked disabled />,

		Keywords/ISBN
		<i>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If input is a 10 or 13 digit number, it's assumed to be an ISBN.
				</li>
				<li>

				</li>

	<li>
		Author
		<i>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Filter by author name. If you just type something like
					<span class="code">Lewis</span>, it will match all
					authors whose name contains that text, however more complex queries can be made by typing in a
					<a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html" target="_blank">
						regular expression <i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>.
					For example, to search for an author whose <i>last name</i> is "Lewis",
					you would use <span class="code">\bLewis$</span>.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</i>
	</li>
	<li>
		Category
		<i>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Filter by category. If you just type something like
					<span class="code">Fiction</span>, it will match all
					categories containing that text, however more complex queries can be made by typing in a
					<a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html" target="_blank">
						regular expression <i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>.
					For example, to search for a category that is fiction but <b>not</b> juvenile fiction,
					you would use <span class="code">(?&lt;!Juvenile )Fiction</span>.
