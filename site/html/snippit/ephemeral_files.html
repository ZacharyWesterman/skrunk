Temporary files, such as thumbnails or QR codes, don't need to hang around once they're no longer in use. Such files are
marked as ephemeral so that the server knows that, once no other data refers to these files, it's ok to delete them and
reclaim space.

Note that ephemeral files don't always disappear immediately after being marked as unused (no references), but will
always be cleaned up eventually.
